# My Book List

Welcome! This is a simple project that keeps a list of recommended programming books(hopefully not only by me).

The main list of books is stored in the `books.json` file.
The `app.py` script is a simple Python program that reads that file and prints.

## 1. For Beginners(like myself): How to Run This Project

If you are new to programming, here is the way to download and run this project. This will give you a copy of the files on your own machine.

### Prerequisites

* You must have **Python** installed.
* You must have **Git** installed.

### Instructions

1.  **Get the URL:** Go to the main page of this repository and click the green **"< > Code"** button. Copy the **HTTPS** URL. It should look like this:
    
    ```bash
    [https://github.com/Corrt1x/Coding-Literature-.git](https://github.com/Corrt1x/Coding-Literature-.git)
    ```

2.  **Clone the Project:** In your terminal, type `git clone` and paste the URL you just copied:
    
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Corrt1x/Coding-Literature-.git](https://github.com/Corrt1x/Coding-Literature-.git)
    ```

3.  **Move into the Folder:** Your terminal can now move into the new folder that was just created.
    ```bash
    cd Coding-Literature-
    ```

4.  **Run the App:** Use Python to run the script.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

That's it! You should see the full list of books printed in your terminal. You can now open this folder in your own code editor (like VS Code) and experiment with the code yourself.

## 2. How to Contribute and Add a Book

I'd love for you to add your favorite books! The best way to do this is to edit the `books.json` file.

1.  Open the `books.json` file.
2.  Click the "Edit" (pencil) icon.
3.  Add your book and a short description using the format:
    `"Book Title": "Your description."`
